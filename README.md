# Digital Ball Clock

The deliverable for this project is a single class that simulates the rolling 
ball clock. It includes the following methods:

A method to simulate the operation of the clock.
A method to calculate the elapsed time for a full clock cycle of 12 hours.
A method to accept user input and display the result of the calculation.
The input from the terminal window will be a number between 27 and 127, 
representing the number of balls in a rolling ball clock. The output will 
be a sentence that explains the number of days that would elapse for a clock 
with the specified number of balls to “reset” the sequence of the balls, i.e., 
return all the balls to their original order in the pickup queue.

The tasks outlined on the right side of this page will enable you to complete 
these deliverables.

The Director of the Marketing Department has commissioned a project for the 
software development team to develop the app. The Marketing Department plans 
to sell the app to OEM companies like Samsung, Apple, and Google to include 
in their standard set of screensavers for all new cell phones and tables.
